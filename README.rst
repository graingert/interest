Features
--------

- event-driven on top of aiohttp/asyncio

    Asyncio is a asynchronous library. Fast and beautifull. It's now 
    is a part of the Python. Meanwhile aiohttp is probably going to 
    be standard HTTP binding for asyncio. Interest is compatible with 
    aiohttp's Request/Response/middleware. 

- consistent, modular and flexible flow model, class-based

    In interest everything processing request is a middleware. It's more 
    like express.js/koa.js than aiohttp.web. Furthermore Interest is 
    fully class-based. For example endpoint is a middleware's method. 
    There are much more interesting things about flow model, 
    see examples and documentation.   

- configurable and pluggable

    Interest is designed to be fully configurable in declarative manner
    without subclassing main components. Interest supports providers 
    and plugins. Virtual plugin repository based on github is a
    work in progress.

Package is authored and maintained by roll <roll@respect31.com>.

Installation
------------

We need Python 3.4+ and higher:

- pip3 install interest

Creating service
----------------

Service is a main interest component. Service can listen on TCP/IP port.
It means that when we create service and call listen method we create
HTTP server:

.. code-block:: python

    # server.py
    from interest import Service, http
    
    
    class Service(Service):
    
        # Public
    
        @http.get('/')
        def hello(self, request):
            return http.Response(text='Hello World!')
    
    
    # Listen forever
    service = Service()
    service.listen(host='127.0.0.1', port=9000, override=True, forever=True)
    
Run the server in the terminal and use another to interact:
    
.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 server.py
    ...
    $ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:9000/; echo
    Hello World!
  
Adding middlewares
------------------

As it was said service is a main interest component but heart of the interest 
is a middleware concept. For example service is also a middleware.  

  Middleware is a coroutine taking http.Request as first argument 
  to return any object.
  
Interest provides class-based middleware with extended API.
For example you can set constraints like HTTP path or methods, 
call the next middleware, get access to the parent service and more:

.. code-block:: python

    # server.py
    import asyncio
    from interest import Service, Middleware, http
    
    
    class Upper(Middleware):
    
        # Public
    
        PREFIX = '/upper'
        METHODS = ['GET']
    
        @asyncio.coroutine
        def process(self, request):
            try:
                # Process request here
                response = (yield from self.next(request))
                # Process response here
                response.text = response.text.upper()
            except http.Exception as exception:
                # Process exception here
                response = exception
            print(self.service)
            return response
    
    
    class Service(Service):
    
        # Public
    
        @http.get('/<key:path>')
        def hello(self, request, key):
            return http.Response(text='Hello World!')
    
    
    # Listen forever
    service = Service(middlewares=[Upper])
    service.listen(host='127.0.0.1', port=9000, override=True, forever=True)
    
Run the server in the terminal and use another to interact:
    
.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 server.py
    ...
    $ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:9000/; echo
    Hello World!
    $ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:9000/upper/; echo
    HELLO WORLD!

Adding endpoints
----------------

Endpoint is a middleware responsible for responding to a request.
To create endpoint you just wrap middleware's method by one or a few http.bind 
functions. We already saw it in a very first example. Add some endpoints: 

.. code-block:: python

  # server.py
    import asyncio
    from interest import Service, Middleware, http
    
    
    class Math(Middleware):
    
        # Public
    
        PREFIX = '/math'
    
        @http.get('/power')
        @http.get('/power/<value:int>')
        def power(self, request, value=1):
            return http.Response(text=str(value ** 2))
    
    
    class Upper(Middleware):
    
        # Public
    
        PREFIX = '/upper'
        METHODS = ['GET']
    
        @asyncio.coroutine
        def process(self, request):
            try:
                # Process request here
                response = (yield from self.next(request))
                # Process response here
                response.text = response.text.upper()
            except http.Exception as exception:
                # Process exception here
                response = exception
            print(self.service)
            return response
    
    
    class Service(Service):
    
        # Public
    
        @http.get('/<key:path>')
        def hello(self, request, key):
            return http.Response(text='Hello World!')
    
    
    # Listen forever
    service = Service(middlewares=[Math, Upper])
    service.listen(host='127.0.0.1', port=9000, override=True, forever=True)
  
Run the server in the terminal and use another to interact:
    
.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 server.py
    ...
    $ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:9000/; echo
    Hello World!
    $ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:9000/upper/; echo
    HELLO WORLD!    
    $ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:9000/math/power/2; echo
    4
    $ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:9000/math/power/two; echo 
    404: Not Found
