Getting Started
===============

.. note::

  It's a full-featured tutorial. 
  For a very starter examples see :doc:`Introduction <introduction>`.
  
Let's say we want a REST service. It sounds pretty reasonable for the
interest tutorial. We want standard functionality some CRUD, few formats
like json and xml/yaml to communicate it with. We want to deploy it 
on server using load balancer like nginx and process manager like supervisor.
Last but not least we want a solid log output to understand 
what's happening with our service.

OK. Let's do it!
